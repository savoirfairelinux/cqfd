== NAME

cqfd - a tool to wrap commands in controlled Docker containers using docker.

== SYNOPSIS

*cqfd* [OPTIONS] [COMMAND] [COMMAND_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_ARGUMENTS]

== DESCRIPTION

*cqfd(1)* provides a quick and convenient way to run commands in the current
directory, but within a Docker container defined in a per-project config file.

This becomes useful when building an application designed for another Linux
system, e.g. building an old embedded firmware that only works in an older
Linux distribution.

== COMMANDS

*init*::
	Initialize project build container.

*exec cmd [args]*::
	Run argument(s) inside build container.

*flavors*::
	List flavors from config file to stdout.

*run [command_string]*::
	Run argument(s) inside build container.

*release [command_string]*::
	Run argument(s) and release software.

*shell [sh_arguments]*::
	Run shell command inside build container.

*help*::
	Show this help text.

By default, the _run_ command is assumed, with the default command string
configured in your _.cqfdrc_ (see build.command).

Command options for run:

*-c <command_arguments>*::
	Append command arguments to the default command string.

== OPTIONS

*-f FILE*::
	Use file as config file (default _.cqfdrc_).

*-d DIR*::
	Use directory as cqfd directory (default _.cqfd_).

*-C DIR*::
	Use the specified working directory.

*-b STRING*::
	Target a specific build flavor.

*-q*::
	Turn on quiet mode.

*-v* or *--version*::
	Show version.

*-h* or *--help*::
	Show this help text.

== EXAMPLES

=== REGULAR BUILD

To build your project from the configured build environment with the default
build command as configured in *cqfdrc(5)*, use:

	$ cqfd

Alternatively, you may want to specify a custom command to be executed from
inside the build container.

	$ cqfd run make clean
	$ cqfd run "make linux-dirclean && make foobar-dirclean"

The _run_ command is broken in some situations, and it is then recommended to
use _exec_ for a single command, _shell -c_ for a command composed with shell
grammar, or _shell_ to run a shell script with or without arguments:

	$ cqfd exec make clean
	$ cqfd shell -c "make linux-dirclean && make foobar-dirclean"
	$ cqfd shell ./build.sh debug

When *cqfd(1)* is running, the current directory is mounted by Docker as a
volume. As a result, all the build artefacts generated inside the container are
still accessible in this directory after the container has been stopped and
removed.

=== RELEASE

The _release_ command behaves exactly like _run_, but creates a release tarball
for your project additionally. The release files (as specified in your
*cqfdrc(5)*) will be included inside the release archive.

	$ cqfd release

The resulting release file is then called according to the archive template,
which defaults to _%Po-%Pn.tar.xz_.

=== FLAVORS

Flavors are used to create alternate build scenarios. For example, to use
another container or another build command.

== ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

*CQFD_DOCKER*::
	Program used to invoke _docker_ client.

*CQFD_EXTRA_RUN_ARGS*::
	A space-separated list of additional docker-run options to be append to
	the starting container. Format is the same as (and passed to)
	docker-run’s options. See 'docker run --help'.

*CQFD_EXTRA_BUILD_ARGS*::
	A space-separated list of additional docker-build options to be append
	to the building image. Format is the same as (and passed to)
	docker-build’s options. See 'docker build --help'.

*CQFD_NO_SSH_CONFIG*::
	Set to _true_ to disable forwarding the global _/etc/ssh_
	configurations to the container. This may be required if the host's
	_ssh_ configuration is not compatible with the _ssh_ version within the
	container.

*CQFD_NO_USER_SSH_CONFIG*::
	Set to _true_ to disable forwarding the user's _~/.ssh_ configuration
	to the container.

*CQFD_NO_USER_GIT_CONFIG*::
	Set to _true_ to disable forwarding the user's _~/.gitconfig_
	configuration to the container.

*CQFD_NO_SSH_AUTH_SOCK*::
	Set to _true_ to disable forwarding the SSH authentication socket to
	the container.

*CQFD_BIND_DOCKER_SOCK*::
	Set to _true_ to enable forwarding the docker socket to the container.

*CQFD_DOCKER_GID*::
	The gid of the docker group in host to map to the cqfd group in the
	container.

*CQFD_SHELL*::
	The shell to be launched, by default _/bin/sh_.

== FILES

*.cqfdrc*::
	Project information config file (See *cqfdrc(5)*).

*.cqfd*::
	Project data directory.

*.cqfd/docker/Dockerfile*::
	Default docker config file (See *Dockerfile(5)*).

== EXAMPLES

=== APPENDING TO THE BUILD COMMAND

The _-c_ option set immediately after the command run allows appending the
command of a cqfd run for temporary developments.

	$ cqfd -b centos7 run -c "clean"
	$ cqfd -b centos7 run -c "TRACING=1"

=== RUNNING A SHELL IN THE CONTAINER

You can use the _shell_ command to quickly pop a shell in your defined
container. The shell to be launched (default _/bin/sh_) can be customized using
the _CQFD_SHELL_ environment variable.

	fred@host:~/project$ cqfd shell
	fred@container:~/project$

=== USE CQFD AS AN INTERPRETER FOR SHELL SCRIPT

You can use the _shell_ command to write a shell script and run it in your
defined container.

	fred@host:~/project$ cat get-container-pretty-name.sh
	#!/usr/bin/env -S cqfd shell
	if ! test -e /.dockerenv; then
		exit 1
	fi
	source /etc/os-release
	echo "$PRETTY_NAME"
	fred@host:~/projet$ ./get-container-pretty-name.sh
	Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

=== USE CQFD AS A STANDARD SHELL FOR BINARIES

You can even use the _shell_ command to use it as a standard _$SHELL_ so
binaries honoring that variable run shell commands in your defined container.

	fred@host:~/project$ make SHELL="cqfd shell"
	Available make targets:
	   help:      This help message
	   install:   Install script, doc and resources
	   uninstall: Remove script, doc and resources
	   tests:     Run functional tests
