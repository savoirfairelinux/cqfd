# Changelog for cqfd

## Version 5.7.1 (2025-08-07)

* Override container entrypoint

## Version 5.7.0 (2025-06-27)

* Many tests improvements
* Add GitHub Actions pipeline
* Lint code with shellcheck
* Add `cqfd exec` command
* Enable overriding the HOME environment using build option `docker_run_args`
* Fix tabulation and space removal in variable expansions
* Cleanup main cqfd codebase
* Add basic Podman support
* Add `CQFD_DOCKER` option to customize the command used to invoke Docker
* Add `CQFD_DOCKER_SOCK` to enable binding the hostâ€™s Docker socket
* Add support for the 'docker_build_args' build option as a declarative
  complement to CQFD_EXTRA_BUILD_ARGS
* Add `%Du` option for unix timestamp in release archive name
* Add `CQFD_NO_SSH_AUTH_SOCK` to disable mounting the SSH authentication socket
  to the container. This fixes an issue on macOS.
* Cleanup the README

## Version 5.6.0 (2024-12-04)

* New `CQFD_NO_USER_SSH_CONFIG` environment variable to disable forwarding user
  ssh config independently of the `/etc/ssh` directory.
* Revert to bash as the default shell.
* Forward .gitconfig to container, with environment variable `CQFD_NO_USER_GIT_CONFIG`
  to disable this behavior
* Add a `--verbose` option
* Improve Bash completions compatibility with zsh.

## Version 5.5.0 (2024-02-25)

* Add the `cqfd shell` command.
* Custom Docker images can now be used using `custom_img_name`.
* Bring Bash completions back up to date.
* Misc. fixes.

## Version 5.4.0 (2023-06-09)

* Changes to the `Dockerfile` since the last `init` are now detected, and will
  raise an error.
* Add the `-c` option to cqfd run/release, to pass extra arguments to the
  pre-defined command.
* The host's `/etc/ssh` directory is now mapped into the container, to pass
  `ssh` clients running in the container the same configuration as on the host.
  Cqfd historically mapped `~/.ssh` into the container for similar reasons. Note
  this feature can be disabled using the `CQFD_NO_SSH_CONFIG` environment
  variable.
* The `flavors=` parameter is not required anymore, as extra flavors in the
  config file are automatically detected.
* When in a project sub-directory, try to locate the `.cqfd` context in parent
  directories automatically.

## Version 5.3.0 (2022-01-05)

* Add the `docker_run_args` .cqfdrc option.
* Misc. documentation fixes.

## Version 5.2.1 (2020-09-14)

* Fixed an error when launching `cqfd run` from a working directory with
  spaces in its hierarchy.
* Misc. fixes to the integrated test suite.

## Version 5.2.0 (2020-11-11)

* Add the `-d` option to specify an alternate cqfd directory.
* Add the `-C` option to change the working directory.
* Date strings now use POSIX options, eg. for running on macOS.
* Containers are now named `cqfd_%user_%company_%project` instead of
  `cqfd_%company_%project`. This prevents collisions with Docker when
  several users are using it on the same machine.
* Add `tar_options` cqfd option to add extra options to tar command.
* Add CQFD_EXTRA_BUILD_ARGS to pass args and options to the image build process.

## Version 5.1.0 (2019-05-13)

* The launcher script in the container now gives extra infos in
  case of failure.
* ``sudo(8)`` is now used to run the commands as the unprivileged user
  in the container instead of ``su(1)``.
* The ``project.build_context`` key allows changing the docker-build
  context directory.
* Options `-v` and `--version` now behave appropriately

## Version 5.0.1 (2018-12-13)

* Fix wrong user homedir in container when host user isn't in /home
* Terminate cqfd in case a legacy CQFD_EXTRA_* variable is used.

## Version 5.0.0

* Use semantic versioning
* CQFD_EXTRA_RUN_ARGS replaces CQFD_EXTRA_VOLUMES,ENV,HOSTS,PORTS.
* The container's user and work directory are now the same as the
  invocating user. This is useful to prevent cases where the build
  process generates symlinks or paths in files that don't match the
  developer's environment.
* New cqfd [-v|--version] to print the version

## Version 4

* Files in an archive are only moved at its root if tar_transform is set to yes.
* Added support for .tar.gz and .zip archives.
