# What is cqfd ? #

cqfd provides a quick and convenient way to run commands in the current
directory, but within a Docker container defined in a per-project config
file.

This becomes useful when building an application designed for another
Linux system, e.g. building an old embedded firmware that only works
in an older Linux distribution.

# Using cqfd #

## Getting started ##

Just follow these steps:

* Install cqfd (see below)
* Make sure your user is a member of the ``docker`` group
* Go into your project's directory
* Create a .cqfdrc file
* Put a Dockerfile and save it as .cqfd/docker/Dockerfile
* Run ``cqfd init``

Examples are available in the samples/ directory.

cqfd will use the provided Dockerfile to create a normalized runtime
build environment for your project.

Warning: Running cqfd init creates and names a new Docker image each
time the Dockerfile is modified, which may lead to a large number of
unused images that cannot be automatically purged. Currently, cqfd
does not have a systematic clean-up system in place.

## Using cqfd on a daily basis ##

### Regular builds ###

To build your project from the configured build environment with the
default build command as configured in .cqfdrc, use:

    $ cqfd

Alternatively, you may want to specify a single custom command to be
executed from inside the build container.

    $ cqfd exec make clean

Or custom commands composed with shell grammar:

    $ cqfd shell -c "make linux-dirclean && make foobar-dirclean"

Or run a shell script with arguments:

    $ cqfd shell ./build.sh debug

When ``cqfd`` is running, the current directory is mounted by Docker
as a volume. As a result, all the build artefacts generated inside the
container are still accessible in this directory after the container
has been stopped and removed.

### Release ###

The release command behaves exactly like run, but creates a release
tarball for your project additionally. The release files (as specified
in your ``.cqfdrc``) will be included inside the release archive.

    $ cqfd release

The resulting release file is then called according to the archive
template, which defaults to ``%Po-%Pn.tar.xz``.

### Flavors ###

Flavors are used to create alternate build scenarios. For example, to
use another container or another build command.

## The .cqfdrc file ##

The .cqfdrc file at the root of your project contains the information
required to support project tooling. It is written in an .ini-like
format and samples/dot-cqfdrc is an example.

Here is a sample .cqfdrc file:

    [project]
    org='fooinc'
    name='buildroot'

    [build]
    command='make foobar_defconfig && make && asciidoc README.FOOINC'
    files='README.FOOINC output/images/sdcard.img'
    archive='cqfd-%Gh.tar.xz'

### Comment ###

The .cqfdrc file supports Unix shell comment; the words after the character `#`
are ignored up to the end of line. A comment cannot be set in the first line,
and after a section.

Note: The traditional .ini comment, i.e. words after the character `;` are not
supported anymore since cqfd 5.7.0.

### The [project] section ###

``org``: a short, lowercase name for the project’s parent organization.

``name``: a short, lowercase name for the project.

``build_context`` (optional): a directory to pass as the build context
to Docker. This should be specified relatively to where cqfd is
invoked.  For example, it can be set to `.`, to use the current
working directory of the invoked `cqfd` command as the Docker build
context, which can be useful when files at the root of the project are
required to build the image.  When using this option, a
``.dockerignore`` file can be useful to limit what gets sent to the
Docker daemon.

``custom_img_name`` (optional): allows specifying a custom Docker image name
instead of the one automatically generated by cqfd. You can also include a
private repository URL in the image name. If you do, cqfd will try to pull the
image from the provided repository, if not already available on your system.

### Docker image naming ###

Unless ``custom_img_name`` is used, Docker images generated by cqfd will be
named `cqfd_$username_$org_$name_$hash`, using the following variables:

* `$username`: The UNIX username used to launch cqfd.
* `$org`: The `org` variable in the `[project]` section of your .cqfdrc.
* `$name`: The `name` variable in the `[project]` section of your .cqfdrc.
* `$hash`: A hash of the local Dockerfile.

### The [build] section ###

``command``: the command string to be executed when cqfd is invoked. This
string will be passed as an argument to a classical ``sh -c "commands"``,
within the build container, to generate the build artefacts.

``files``: an optional space-separated list of files generated by the
build process that we want to include inside a standard release
archive.

``archive``: the optional name of the release archive generated by
cqfd. You can include environment variable names, as well as the
following template marks:

* ``%Gh`` - git short hash of last commit
* ``%GH`` - git long hash of last commit
* ``%D3`` - RFC3339 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
* ``%Du`` - Unix timestamp
* ``%Cf`` - current cqfd flavor name (if any)
* ``%Po`` - value of the ``project.org`` configuration key
* ``%Pn`` - value of the ``project.name`` configuration key
* ``%%`` - a litteral '%' sign

By default, cqfd will generate a release archive named
``org-name.tar.xz``, where 'org' and 'name' come from the project's
configuration keys. The .tar.xz, .tar.gz and .zip archive formats are
supported.

For tar archives:

* Setting ``tar_transform=yes`` will cause all files specified for the
  archive to be stored at the root of the archive, which is desired in
  some scenarios.

* Setting ``tar_options`` will pass extra options to
  the tar command. For example, setting ``tar_options=-h`` will copy
  all symlink files as hardlinks, which is desired in some scenarios.

``distro``: the name of the directory containing the Dockerfile. By
default, cqfd uses ``"docker"``, and ``.cqfd/docker/Dockerfile` is
used.

``user_extra_groups``: an optional, space-separated list of groups the user
should be a member of in the container. You can either use the ``group:gid``
format, or simply specify the ``group`` name if it exists either in the host or
inside the docker image.

``flavors`` (optional): the list of build flavors (see below). Each flavor has
its own command just like `build.command`. This property is now automatically
deduced from the flavors sections of .cqfdc.

``docker_build_args`` (optional): arguments used to invoke `docker build`.
For example, to attempt to pull newer version of the image, it can be set like:
```
docker_build_args='--pull=true'
```

``docker_run_args`` (optional): arguments used to invoke `docker run`.
For example, to share networking with the host, it can be set like:
```
docker_run_args='--network=host'
```

### Using build flavors ###

In some cases, it may be desirable to build the project using
variations of the build and release methods (for example a debug
build). This is made possible in cqfd with the build flavors feature.

In the .cqfdrc file, one or more flavors may be listed in the
``[build]`` section, referencing other sections named following
flavor's name.

    [centos7]
    command='make CENTOS=1'
    distro='centos7'

    [debug]
    command='make DEBUG=1'
    files='myprogram Symbols.map'

    [build]
    command='make'
    files='myprogram'

A flavor will typically redefine some keys of the build section:
command, files, archive, distro.

Flavors from a `.cqfdrc` file can be listed using the `flavors` argument.

### Environment variables ###

The following environment variables are supported by cqfd to provide
the user with extra flexibility during his day-to-day development
tasks:

``CQFD_DOCKER``: program used to invoke `docker` client.
For example, to use docker if not in the docker group, it can be set like:
```
docker='sudo docker'
```

``CQFD_EXTRA_RUN_ARGS``: A space-separated list of additional
docker-run options to be append to the starting container.
Format is the same as (and passed to) docker-run’s options.
See 'docker run --help'.

``CQFD_EXTRA_BUILD_ARGS``: A space-separated list of additional
docker-build options to be append to the building image.
Format is the same as (and passed to) docker-build’s options.
See 'docker build --help'.

``CQFD_NO_SSH_CONFIG``: Set to ``true`` to disable forwarding the global
``/etc/ssh`` configurations to the container. This may be required if
the host's ``ssh`` configuration is not compatible with the ``ssh``
version within the container.

``CQFD_NO_USER_SSH_CONFIG``: Set to ``true`` to disable forwarding
the user's ``~/.ssh`` configuration to the container.

``CQFD_NO_USER_GIT_CONFIG``: Set to ``true`` to disable forwarding
the user's ``~/.gitconfig`` configuration to the container.

``CQFD_BIND_DOCKER_SOCK``: Set to ``true`` to enable forwarding the
docker socket to the container.

``CQFD_DOCKER_GID``: The gid of the docker group in host to map to
the cqfd group in the container.

``CQFD_SHELL``: The shell to be launched, by default ``/bin/sh``.

### Appending to the build command ###

The `-c` option set immediately after the command run allows appending the
command of a cqfd run for temporary developments:

    $ cqfd -b centos7 run -c "clean"
    $ cqfd -b centos7 run -c "TRACING=1"

### Running a shell in the container ###

You can use the `shell` command to quickly pop a shell in your defined
container. The shell to be launched (default `/bin/sh`) can be customized using
the `CQFD_SHELL` environment variable.

Example:

    fred@host:~/project$ cqfd shell
    fred@container:~/project$

### Use cqfd as an interpreter for shell script ###

You can use the `shell` command to write a shell script and run it in your
defined container.

Example:

    fred@host:~/project$ cat get-container-pretty-name.sh 
    #!/usr/bin/env -S cqfd shell
    if ! test -e /.dockerenv; then
        exit 1
    fi
    source /etc/os-release
    echo "$PRETTY_NAME"
    fred@host:~/projet$ ./get-container-pretty-name.sh 
    Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

### Use cqfd as a standard shell for binaries ###

You can even use the `shell` command to use it as a standard `$SHELL` so
binaries honoring that variable run shell commands in your defined container.

Example:

    fred@host:~/project$ make SHELL="cqfd shell"
    Available make targets:
       help:      This help message
       install:   Install script, doc and resources
       uninstall: Remove script, doc and resources
       tests:     Run functional tests

### Other command-line options ###

In some conditions you may want to use alternate cqfd filenames and / or an
external working directory. These options can be used to control the cqfd
configuration files:

The working directory can be changed using the `-C` option:

    $ cqfd -C external/directory

An alternate cqfd directory can be specified with the `-d` option:

    $ cqfd -d cqfd_alt

An alternate cqfdrc file can be specified with the `-f` option:

    $ cqfd -f cqfdrc_alt

These options can be combined together:

    $ cqfd -C external/directory -d cqfd_alt -f cqfdrc_alt
    $ # cqfd will use:
    $ #  - cqfd directory: external/directory/cqfd_alt
    $ #  - cqfdrc file: external/directory/cqfdrc_alt

## Build Container Environment ##

When cqfd runs, a docker container is launched as the environment in
which to run the *command*.  Within this environment, commands are run
as the same user as the one invoking cqfd (with a fallback to the
'builder' user in case it cannot be determined). So that this user has
access to local files, the current working directory is mapped to
the same location inside the container.

### SSH Handling ###

The local ~/.ssh directory is also mapped to the corresponding
directory in the build container. This effectively enables SSH agent
forwarding so a build can, for example, pull authenticated git repos.

### Terminal job control ###

When cqfd runs a command as the unprivileged user that called it in
the first place, ``su(1)`` is used to run the command. This brings a
limitation for processes that require a controlling terminal (such as
an interactive shell), as ``su`` will prevent the command executed
from having one.

```
$ cqfd bash
bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
```

To workaround this limitation, cqfd will use ``sudo(8)`` when it is
available in the container instead. The user is responsible for
including it in the related Dockerfile.

## Requirements ##

To use cqfd, ensure the following requirements are satisfied on your
workstation:

-  Bash 4.x

-  Docker

-  A ``docker`` group in your /etc/group

-  Your username is a member of the ``docker`` group

-  Restart your docker service if you needed to create the group.

## Installing/removing cqfd ##

If you use the [GNU Guix](https://gnu.org/software/guix) package
manager, you can install `cqfd` via:

```sh
guix install cqfd
```

Otherwise, the following describes how you can install it system-wide
from source.

Install or remove the script and its resources:

    $ make install
    $ make uninstall

Makefile honors both **PREFIX** (__/usr/local__) and **DESTDIR** (__[empty]__)
variables:

    $ make install PREFIX=/opt
    $ make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=package

## Using podman ##

Podman may be used instead of Docker, but with limited functionalities,
for example when dealing with extra groups.

To use podman instead of docker, you can set in your environment,
like your `.bashrc`, `.profile` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
CQFD_DOCKER="podman"
PODMAN_USERNS="keep-id"
```

## Testing cqfd (for developers) ##

The codebase contains tests which can be invoked using the following
command, if the above requirements are met on the system:

    $ make tests

## Trivia ##

CQFD stands for "Ce qu'il fallait Dockeriser", french for "what needed
to be dockerized".
